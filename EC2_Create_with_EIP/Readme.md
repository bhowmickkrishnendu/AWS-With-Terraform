#  Mumbai Cloud Adventure Awaits! üáÆüá≥ ‚òÅÔ∏è

## ‚ú® Unleash the Power of Terraform with This Code ‚ú®

This Terraform configuration is your launchpad to create a secure and accessible EC2 instance in Mumbai, complete with a key pair, security group, and Elastic IP address.

Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

**1. Key Pair for Secure Access **

- Generates a 4096-bit RSA key pair for encrypted SSH connections 
- Public key is saved as a Terraform output 
- Private key is securely stored locally for future SSH access Ô∏è

**2. Security Group for Controlled Traffic Ô∏è**

- Creates a security group named "Mumbai_First_Server-SG" 
- Allows inbound SSH traffic on port 22 from any source (0.0.0.0/0) 
- Permits all outbound traffic 

**3. EC2 Instance Launch **

- Provisions a t2.micro EC2 instance with the specified AMI 
- Places the instance within the designated VPC subnet 
- Assigns the created security group for traffic control Ô∏è
- Associates a public IP address for direct access 
- Disables accidental API termination for protection 

**4. Elastic IP Address for Persistence **

- Allocates an Elastic IP address and associates it with the instance 
- Ensures a consistent public IP address, even after instance restarts 

**5. Outputs for Easy Retrieval **

- Exposes the following information as Terraform outputs:
   - Private IP address of the instance 
   - EC2 instance ID 
   - Elastic IP address
